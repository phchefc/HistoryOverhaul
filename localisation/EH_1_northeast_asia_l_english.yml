 eh_asia_east_turkestan.12.d:0 "Moghulistan (1347-1462) was a Mongol breakaway khanate of the Chagatai Khanate and a historical geographic area north of the Tengri Tagh mountain range, on the border of Central Asia and East Asia. That area today includes parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and northwest Xinjiang, China. A khanate nominally ruled over the area from the mid-14th century until the late 17th century, although it is debatable whether it was a continuation of the Chagatai Khanate, an independent khanate, or a tributary state to Ming Dynasty China. Beginning in the mid-14th century a new khanate, in the form of a nomadic tribal confederacy headed by a member of the family of Chagatai, arose in the region of the Ili River. It is therefore considered to be a continuation of the Chagatai Khanate, but it is also referred to as the Moghul Khanate."

 eh_asia_TIB.1.d:0 "The Tibetan Empire existed from the 7th to 9th centuries CE when Tibet was unified as a large and powerful empire. From the 7th to the 9th century a series of emperors ruled Tibet. From the time of the emperor Songtsen Gampo the power of the empire gradually increased over a diverse terrain. By the reign of the emperor Ralpacan, in the opening years of the 9th century, it controlled territories extending from the Tarim basin to the Himalayas and Bengal, and from the Pamirs to what is now Chinese provinces of Gansu and Yunnan."

 eh_asia_TIB.2.d:0 "After the An Lushan Rebellion the office of Protector General was given to Guo Xin who defended the area and the four garrisons even after communication had been cut off from Chang'an by the Tibetan Empire. The last five years of the protectorate are regarded as an uncertain period in its history, but most sources agree that the last vestiges of the protectorate and its garrisons were defeated by Tibetan forces by the year 790, ending nearly 150 years of Tang influence in central Asia."

 eh_asia_TIB.3.d:0 "The Era of Fragmentation is a period of Tibetan history in the 9th and 10th century. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier Tibetan Empire collapsed following a civil war between Yum brtan and ’Od-srung. The period was dominated by rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords."

 eh_asia_TIB.4.d:0 "The Khoshut Khanate was an Oirat khanate based in the Tibetan Plateau in the 17th and the 18th centuries. It was established in 1642 by Gushi Khan, a Khoshut prince and leader of the Upper Mongols. He was enthroned by the Dalai Lama as Khan and protector-ruler of Tibet. With Gushi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state. This Tibetan government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, which was lasted until the 1950s. The Khoshut Khanate was conquered by the troops of the Dzungar Khanate in 1717. However, the Dzungars were in turn expelled by the expedition forces of the Qing dynasty from Tibet in 1720."

These regions came under the control of China after attempts by the government of Tibet to gain international recognition, efforts to modernize its military, negotiations between the government of Tibet and the CHN, a military conflict in the Qamdo area of Western Kham in October 1950, and the eventual acceptance of the Seventeen Point Agreement by the government of Tibet under Chinese pressure in October 1951.

Over the years the Tibetan government in exile, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), has shifted the goal of its resistance stance from attempting measured cooperation with autonomy, to demanding full independence, to seeking "genuine autonomy for all Tibetans living in the three traditional provinces of Tibet within the framework of China."
