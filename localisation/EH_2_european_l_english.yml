 eh_roman_history.2.d:0 "The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest took place in the Teutoburg Forest in 9, when an alliance of Germanic tribes ambushed and destroyed three Roman legions and their auxiliaries, led by Publius Quinctilius Varus. The alliance was led by Arminius, a Germanic officer of Varus's auxilia. Despite several successful campaigns and raids by the Romans in the years after the battle, they never again attempted to conquer the Germanic territories east of the Rhine river. The victory of the Germanic tribes against Rome's legions in the Teutoburg Forest would have far-reaching effects on the subsequent history of both the ancient Germanic peoples and the Roman Empire."

 eh_roman_history.3.d:0 "Nero (r. 54-68) was the last Roman emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Nero's rule is usually associated with tyranny and extravagance. Most Roman sources offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign; Tacitus claims that the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt. Suetonius tells that many Romans believed that the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear the way for his planned palatial complex, the Domus Aurea. In 68, Vindex, who was supported by Galba, rebelled. Nero fled Rome when Rome's discontented civil and military authorities chose Galba as emperor. He committed suicide on June 9, 68 CE. His death ended the Julio-Claudian dynasty, sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the Year of the Four Emperors."

Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders and the unification of the empire's disparate peoples. He is known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Britannia. He adopted Antoninus Pius in 138 and nominated him as a successor."

He was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good Emperors, and the last emperor of the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace and stability for the Roman Empire. The reign of Marcus Aurelius was marked by military conflict. Germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. He modified the silver purity of the Roman currency, the denarius. The persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire is believed to have increased during his reign. The Antonine Plague broke out in 165 or 166 and devastated the population of the Roman Empire, causing the deaths of five million people. Marcus adopted an heir unlike some of his predecessors; Commodus."

The decisive defeat of the Byzantine army and the capture of the Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes played an important role in undermining Byzantine authority in Anatolia and Armenia, and allowed for the gradual Turkification of Anatolia.

Urban called for a military expedition to aid the Byzantine Empire, which had recently lost most of Anatolia to the Seljuq Turks. The resulting military expedition of primarily Frankish nobles not only re-captured much of Anatolia but went on to conquer the Holy Land, which had fallen to Islamic expansion as early as the 7th century, and culminated in July 1099 in the re-conquest of Jerusalem and the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099-1291)."

The Crusader states in the Levant-the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli, and the County of Edessa-were the first examples of "Europe overseas'. Between them, they span the period from 1098 to 1291.

It was partially successful, recapturing the important cities of Acre and Jaffa, and reversing most of Saladin's conquests, but it failed to recapture Jerusalem, which was the major aim of the Crusade and its religious focus. On 2 September 1192, Richard I (r. 1189-1199) and Saladin finalized the Treaty of Jaffa, which granted Muslim control over Jerusalem but allowed unarmed Christian pilgrims and merchants to visit the city."

However, a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army sacking the city of Constantinople, the capital of the Greek Christian-controlled Byzantine Empire.

The Mongol invasions also occurred in Central Europe, which led to warfare among fragmented Poland and Hungary. The operations were planned by General Subutai (1175-1248) and commanded by Batu Khan (c. 1207-1255) and Kadan. Warring European princes realized they had to cooperate in the face of a Mongol invasion, so local wars and conflicts were suspended in parts of central Europe, only to be resumed after the Mongols had withdrawn."

The most common reason given for this withdrawal is the Great Khan Ogedei's death on December 11, 1241. Another theory is that weather data preserved in tree rings points to a series of warm, dry summers in the region until 1242. Regardless of their reasons, the Mongols had completely withdrawn from Central Europe by mid-1242, though they still launched military operations in the west at this time, most notably the 1241-1243 Mongol invasion of Anatolia. Batu specifically decided against attending the kurultai in favor of staying in Europe, which delayed the ceremony for several years."

The Black Death is thought to have originated in the dry plains of Central Asia, where it travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1343. From there, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that traveled on all merchant ships, spreading throughout the Mediterranean Basin and Europe. The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe's population. The plague recurred as outbreaks in Europe until the 19th century."

In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend over Anatolia and the Balkans. As the Turks expanded into the Balkans, the conquest of Constantinople became a crucial objective. The Ottomans had already wrested control of nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but the heavy defence of Constantinople's strategic position on the Bosphorus Strait made it difficult to conquer."

After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmet transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from Edirne to Constantinople and established his court there. The capture of the city marked the end of the Roman Empire, a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years. The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear. The conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire was a key event in the Late Middle Ages which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period."

The conquest marks the westernmost expansion of both the Umayyad Caliphate and Muslim rule into Europe. Conversion to Islam proceeded at an increasing pace.

Wessex under Alfred the Great (r. 871-899) was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw (865-954).

Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete.

The Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Treasury of Merit had no foundation in the Bible. The Peace of Augsburg was a treaty between Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and the Schmalkaldic League, signed in September 1555 at Augsburg. It officially ended the religious struggle between the two groups and made the legal division of Christianity permanent within the Holy Roman Empire, allowing rulers to choose either Lutheranism or Roman Catholicism as the official confession of their state."

As a result of the Thirty Years' War, Bourbon France risen, the curtailing of Habsburg ambition, and the ascendancy of Sweden as a great power created a new balance of power on the continent, with France emerging from the war strengthened and increasingly dominant in the latter part of the 17th century."

The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.
