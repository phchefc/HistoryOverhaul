In the 7th century, allied with China under the Tang dynasty, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula for the first time in Korean history, allowing for the first united Korean national identity. After the fall of Baekje and Goguryeo, the Tang dynasty established a short-lived military government to administer parts of the Korean peninsula.

The United Nations, with the United States as the principal force, came to the aid of South Korea. China came to the aid of North Korea, and the Soviet Union also gave some assistance to the North. After the first two months of war, South Korean and U.S. forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat, forced back to a small area in the south known as the Pusan Perimeter."

Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong.

The practice of Juche is firmly rooted in the ideals of sustainability through agricultural independence and a lack of dependency.

Economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support caused food production and imports to decline rapidly. A series of floods and droughts exacerbated the crisis. The North Korean government and its centrally planned system proved too inflexible to effectively curtail the disaster. Estimates of the death toll vary widely. Out of a total population of approximately 22 million, somewhere between 240,000 and 3,500,000 North Koreans died from starvation or hunger-related illnesses, with the deaths peaking in 1997. A 2011 U.S. Census Bureau report put the likely number of excess deaths during 1993 to 2000 at from 500,000 to 600,000."

The Sunshine Policy was formally abandoned by South Korean President Lee Myung-bak (1941-) in 2007.

Though it initially enjoyed wide acceptance, even being supported as the state ideology during the Goryeo period, Buddhism in Korea suffered extreme repression during the Joseon period, which lasted over five hundred years.

Meanwhile, As Japan expanded its control of Korea, Shintoism also expanded the number of shrines, with the aim of one national shrine in each province. With Japan's surrender and the invasion of Korea, Shinto shrines were the focus of contempt in the streets of Seoul, with papers posted on walls urging citizens to burn them down. As Koreans began pilfering smaller shrines around the country, Shinto priests at Chosen shrine withdrew Japanese relics, and soon created a plan to destroy the Korean National Shrine of their own accord.

However, Baekje failed to get its emissary back and was unable to receive the military support of Northern Wei. In response, Jangsu secretly planned to attack Baekje.
