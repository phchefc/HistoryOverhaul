However, the Timurid Empire went into terminal decline following Timur's death just three years after the battle, while the Ottoman Empire made a full recovery, and continued to increase in power for another two to three centuries."

 eh_asia_turkey.8.d:0 "The Fall of Constantinople was the capture of the capital city of the Byzantine Empire by an invading Ottoman army on 29 May 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmet transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from Edirne to Constantinople and established his court there. The capture of the city marked the end of the Roman Empire, a state which dated to 27 BCE, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years. The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear. The conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire was a key event in the Late Middle Ages which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period."

During this time, there were several attempts by the Greeks to gain independence from Ottoman control. On 25 March the revolution was officially declared and by the end of the month, the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Turks. Following years of negotiation, three Great Powers—Russia, Britain and France—decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. After eight years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent, sovereign state under the London Protocol of February 1830."

Causes included the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the check of the Russian Empire in Britain and France. Sevastopol fell after eleven months, and neutral countries began to join the Allied cause. Isolated and facing a bleak prospect of invasion from the west if the war continued, Russia sued for peace in March 1856.
