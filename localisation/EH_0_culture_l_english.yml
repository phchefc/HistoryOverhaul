The Greek and Roman paganism had been completely replaced by Christianity around the 4th and 5th centuries. Art and literature, law, education, and politics were preserved in the teachings of the Church, in an environment that, otherwise, would have probably seen their loss. The Church founded many cathedrals, universities, monasteries and seminaries, some of which continue to exist today."

 eh_culture.8.t:0 "Renaissance"
 eh_culture.8.d:0 "The Renaissance was a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to Modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries. The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism. This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete. Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe."
 eh_culture.8.a:0 "Okay."
 eh_culture.9.t:0 "Baroque"
 eh_culture.9.d:0 "The Baroque is a style of architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture and other arts that flourished in Europe from the early 17th century until the 1740s.

 eh_culture.9.a:0 "Okay."
 eh_culture.10.t:0 "Rococo"
 eh_culture.10.d:0 "The Rococo is an exceptionally ornamental and theatrical style of architecture, art and decoration which combines asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colors, sculpted molding, and trompe l'oeil frescoes to create surprise and the illusion of motion and drama. It is often described as the final expression of the Baroque movement. It also came to influence the other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware and glassware, painting, music, and theatre. The Rococo style began in France in the 1730s as a reaction against the more formal and geometric Style Louis XIV. It soon spread to other parts of Europe."

 eh_culture.11.t:0 "Neoclassicism"
 eh_culture.11.d:0 "The Neoclassicism was a Western cultural movement in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that drew inspiration from the art and culture of classical antiquity. The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century. European Neoclassicism in the arts began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant Rococo style."

 eh_culture.12.d:0 "The Romanticism was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature—all components of modernity. It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing liberalism, radicalism, conservatism, and nationalism."
 eh_culture.12.a:0 "Okay."
 eh_culture.13.t:0 "Late 19th century culture"
 eh_culture.13.d:0 "The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. Technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats, and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories. During the Industrial Revolution, an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic movement. Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes."
 eh_culture.13.a:0 "Okay."
 eh_culture.14.t:0 "Contemporary culture"
 eh_culture.14.d:0 "By the 20th century, Western culture was exported worldwide, and the development and growth of international transport and telecommunication played a decisive role in modern globalization. The West has contributed a great many technological, political, philosophical, artistic and religious aspects to modern international culture. The West invented cinema, television, the personal computer and the Internet. The emergent mass media  created a global culture that could ignore national frontiers. Literacy became almost universal, encouraging the growth of books, magazines and newspapers. The influence of cinema and radio remained, while televisions became near essentials in every home."

 eh_humanities.5.d:0 "The Protestant Reformation was a movement within Western Christianity in the 16th-century Europe that posed a religious and political challenge to the Roman Catholic Church and papal authority in particular. The Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Treasury of Merit had no foundation in the Bible. The Peace of Augsburg was a treaty between Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and the Schmalkaldic League, signed in September 1555 at Augsburg. It officially ended the religious struggle between the two groups and made the legal division of Christianity permanent within the Holy Roman Empire, allowing rulers to choose either Lutheranism or Roman Catholicism as the official confession of their state."

Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death. Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. Christians disapproved of the games because they involved idolatrous pagan rituals, and the popularity of gladatorial contests declined in the 5th century, leading to their disappearance."
