Thereafter, the Sasanian Empire roughly stopped at Merv. Next, circa 390-410 CE, the Kidarites invaded northwestern India, where they replaced the remnants of the Kushan Empire in the area of Punjab."

 eh_asia_indian.20.d:0 "Akbar was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to 1605. Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari River. He created a new ruling elite We will be loyal to him, implemented a modern administration, and encouraged cultural developments. He increased trade with European trading companies."
 eh_asia_indian.20.a:0 "Long live the Emperor!"
 eh_asia_indian.21.t:0 "Mughul expansion"
 eh_asia_indian.21.d:0 "A strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include most of the Indian subcontinent. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance."
 eh_asia_indian.21.a:0 "Great!"
 eh_asia_indian.22.t:0 "Shah Jahan"
 eh_asia_indian.22.d:0 "Shah Jahan was the fifth Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1628 to 1658. His reign represented the height of the Mughal architecture, most notably the Taj Mahal. His relationship with his wife Mumtaz Mahal has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature, and cinema. In September 1657, Shah Jahan fell seriously ill. This set off a war of succession among his four sons in which his third son, Aurangzeb, emerged victorious. Shah Jahan recovered from his illness, but Aurangzeb put his father under house arrest in Agra Fort from July 1658 until his death in January 1666."
 eh_asia_indian.22.a:0 "Long live the Emperor!"
 eh_asia_indian.23.t:0 "Aurangzeb"
 eh_asia_indian.23.d:0 "Aurangzeb was the sixth Mughal emperor, who ruled over almost the entire Indian subcontinent for a period of 49 years (r. 1658-1707). Widely considered to be the last effective ruler of the Mughal Empire, Aurangzeb compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, sharia based compilation, and was among the few monarchs to have fully established Sharia law and Islamic economics throughout the Indian subcontinent. He was an accomplished military leader whose rule has been the subject of praise, though he has also been described as the most controversial ruler in Indian history."
 eh_asia_indian.23.a:0 "Long live the Emperor!"
 eh_asia_indian.24.t:0 "Maratha Empire"
 eh_asia_indian.24.d:0 "The Maratha Empire was a power that dominated a large portion of the Indian subcontinent in the 18th century. The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of Shivaji as the Chhatrapati and ended in 1818 with the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II. The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending Mughal rule in India."
 eh_asia_indian.24.a:0 "Great!"
 eh_asia_indian.25.t:0 "Mughul expansion"
 eh_asia_indian.25.d:0 "Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist; during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent, ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent. During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres, and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects. Under his reign, India surpassed Qing China to become the world's largest economy and biggest manufacturing power, worth nearly a quarter of global GDP and more than the entirety of Western Europe."
 eh_asia_indian.25.a:0 "Long live the Emperor!"
 eh_asia_indian.26.t:0 "Death of Aurangzeb"
 eh_asia_indian.26.d:0 "In 1707, Aurangzeb's son, Bahadur Shah I, succeeded him and the empire, both because of Aurangzeb's over-extension and because of Bahadur Shah's weak military and leadership qualities, entered a period of terminal decline. Immediately after Bahadur Shah occupied the throne, the Maratha Empire - which Aurangzeb had held at bay, inflicting high human and monetary costs even on his own empire - consolidated and launched effective invasions of Mughal territory, seizing power from the weak emperor."

 eh_asia_indian.27.t:0 "Decline of the Mughul Empire"
 eh_asia_indian.27.d:0 "During the reign of Muhammad Shah, the empire began to break up, and vast tracts of central India passed from Mughal to Maratha hands. The far-off Indian campaign of Nadir Shah culminated with the Sack of Delhi and shattered the remnants of Mughal power and prestige. Many of the empire's elites now sought to control their own affairs, and broke away to form independent kingdoms."
 eh_asia_indian.27.a:0 "Terrible!"
 eh_asia_indian.28.t:0 "Maratha expansion"
 eh_asia_indian.28.d:0 "After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, Shahu, grandson of Shivaji, was released by the Mughals. The empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south, to Peshawar in the north, and Bengal Subah in the east.  In 1761, the Maratha Army lost the Third Battle of Panipat against Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire, which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan. Ten years after Panipat, the young Peshwa Madhavrao I's Maratha Resurrection reinstated Maratha authority over North India."

 eh_asia_indian.29.t:0 "British East Indian Company"
 eh_asia_indian.29.d:0 "The East India Company (1600-1874) was an English and later British joint-stock company. The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600, coming relatively late to trade in the Indies. During its first century of operation, the focus of the company was trade, not the building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, the French East India Company. The company eventually came to rule large areas of India with its private armies, exercising military power and seizing administrative functions."

 eh_asia_indian.30.t:0 "British Colonization of India"
 eh_asia_indian.30.d:0 "In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, which led to the First Anglo-Maratha War. The Marathas were victorious. The Maratha remained the pre-eminent power in India until their defeat in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars (1805-1818), which resulted in the East India Company seizing control of most of India. At the end of the war, all of the Maratha powers had surrendered to the British."

 eh_asia_indian.32.d:0 "The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising in India in 1857-58 against the rule of the British East India Company. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebels quickly reached Delhi, and Mughal ruler Bahadur Shah Zafar was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September."

 eh_asia_indian.33.d:0 "The British Raj was the rule by the British Crown on the Indian subcontinent from 1858 to 1947. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria. The region under British control was commonly called India in contemporaneous usage, and included areas directly administered by the United Kingdom, which were collectively called British India, plus those ruled by indigenous rulers, but under British tutelage or paramountcy, called the princely states."

 eh_asia_indian.34.d:0 "After World War I, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi, and noted for nonviolence. Later, the All-India Muslim League would advocate for a separate Muslim-majority nation state. The British Indian Empire was partitioned in August 1947 into the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan, each gaining its independence. The partition involved the division of two provinces, Bengal and the Punjab, based on district-wise non-Muslim or Muslim majorities. The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that plagues their relationship to the present."

 eh_asia_indian.35.d:0 "The Annexation of Goa was the process in which the Republic of India annexed the former Portuguese Indian territories of Goa, Daman and Diu, starting with the armed action carried out by the Indian Armed Forces in December 1961. In India, the action was seen as a liberation of historically Indian territory, while Portugal viewed it as an aggression against its national soil and citizens."

Later the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement led to the Liberation War and eventually resulted in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation in 1971. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's political movement arose in the country in the early 20th century to obtain political independence, which was granted in 1948; the country became a republic and adopted its current name in 1972."
