 eh_britain.3.t:0 "Early Anglo-Saxons"
 eh_britain.3.d:0 "The early Anglo-Saxon period covers the history of medieval Britain that starts from the end of Roman rule. By the year 400, southern Britain - that is Britain south of Hadrian's Wall - was a peripheral part of the western Roman Empire, occasionally lost to rebellion or invasion, but until then always eventually recovered. Around 410, Britain slipped beyond direct imperial control into a phase which has generally been termed "sub-Roman"."

 eh_britain.4.d:0 "By 660 the political map of Lowland Britain had developed with smaller territories coalescing into kingdoms, and from this time larger kingdoms started dominating the smaller kingdoms. The kingdom of Mercia dominated the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The Anglo-Saxons converted to Christianity in the 7th century and a network of monasteries and convents was built across England."

 eh_britain.6.d:0 "In the early 9th century Mercia (527-918) was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex (519-927). Wessex under Alfred the Great (r. 871-899) was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw (865-954). This brought about the political unification of England. Despite repeated crises of succession and a Danish seizure of power at the start of the 11th century it can also be argued that by the 1060s England was a powerful, centralised state."

 eh_britain.7.t:0 "Norman Conquest"
 eh_britain.7.d:0 "A dispute over the succession to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language."

 eh_britain.8.d:0 "The Angevin Empire (1154-1214) describes the possessions of the Angevin kings of England who held lands in England and France during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Angevins of the House of Plantagenet ruled over an area covering roughly half of France, all of England, and parts of Ireland and Wales, and had further influence over much of the remaining British Isles."

 eh_britain.10.t:0 "Hundred Years' War - First Phase"
 eh_britain.10.d:0 "The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the House of Plantagenet, rulers of the Kingdom of England, against the French House of Valois, over the right to rule the Kingdom of France. The first phase of the Hundred Years' War is called the Edwardian War. The dynastic conflict was caused by disputes over the French feudal sovereignty over Aquitaine and the English claims over the French royal title. King Edward III of England and his son Edward the Black Prince, led their armies on a largely successful campaign across France with notable victories. The Treaty of Bretigny was later ratified by the two Kings John and Edward as the Treaty of Calais on 24 October 1360. Under the terms of the treaty Edward agreed to renounce the French crown. In return he obtained full sovereign rights over an expanded Aquitaine and Calais."

 eh_britain.11.t:0 "Hundred Years' War - Second Phase"
 eh_britain.11.d:0 "The Caroline War was the second phase of the Hundred Years' War. The Black Prince of England (1330-1376) spent a huge sum of money in order to restore Peter the Cruel to the throne of Castile. The Castilian King was unable to repay him, however, so the Black Prince raised the taxes in his domains in Aquitaine. The people's complaints were unheeded, so they appealed to the French King Charles V. Charles immediately set out to reverse the territorial losses imposed at Bretigny and he was largely successful in his lifetime. His successor, Charles VI, made peace with the son of the Black Prince, Richard II (r. 1377-1399), in 1389. This truce was extended many times until the war was resumed in 1415."
 eh_britain.11.a:0 "We have failed to defend our lands."
 eh_britain.12.t:0 "Peasants" Revolt"
 eh_britain.12.d:0 "The Peasants" Revolt was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War. In 1381, a Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler spread across large parts of England. It was suppressed by Richard II, with the death of 1,500 rebels."
 eh_britain.12.a:0 "This revolt will heavily influenced to the war."
 eh_britain.13.t:0 "Hundred Years' War - Third Phase"
 eh_britain.13.d:0 "The Lancastrian War was the third and final phase of the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War. It lasted from 1415, when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453, when the English lost Bordeaux. The first half of this phase of the war was dominated by the England. The second half of this phase of the war was dominated by the France. With charismatic leaders such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, and with England losing its main allies, the French forces counterattacked. Charles VII of France was crowned in Notre-Dame de Reims in 1429, and from then a slow but steady reconquest of English-held French territories ensued."
 eh_britain.13.a:0 "We've got a chance of winning!"
 eh_britain.14.t:0 "Hundred Years' War - Final Phase"
 eh_britain.14.d:0 "After Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. English were decisively defeated at the Battle of Castillon on 17 July 1453. Although the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War, England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years. After the Treaty of Picquigny of 1475, the Hundred Years' War formally ended with Edward IV of England (r. 1461-1470) renouncing his claim to the throne of France."
 eh_britain.14.a:0 "I declare the loss of succession to the French throne."
 eh_britain.15.t:0 "War of the Roses"
 eh_britain.15.d:0 "The Wars of the Roses were a series of English civil wars for control of the throne of England fought between supporters of two rival cadet branches of the royal House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and and the House of York. The conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between 1455 and 1487, but there was related fighting before and after this period between the parties. The Lancastrian Henry Tudor ended the War of the Roses and established the Tudor dynasty in 1485."
 eh_britain.15.a:0 "Do you like red or white?"
 
 eh_britain.16.t:0 "Rise of the Tudors"
 eh_britain.16.d:0 "The House of Tudor was an English royal house. Tudor monarchs ruled the Kingdom of England from 1485 until 1603, with five monarchs in that period: Henry VII (r. 1485-1509), Henry VIII (r. 1509-1547), Edward VI (r. 1547-1553), Mary I (r. 1533-1558) and Elizabeth I (r. 1558-1603). The first Tudor monarch, Henry VII of England, descended through his mother from a legitimised branch of the English royal House of Lancaster. The Tudor family rose to power in the wake of the Wars of the Roses (1455-1487), which left the House of Lancaster, with which the Tudors were aligned, extinct in the male line."
 eh_britain.16.a:0 "Long Live the King!"
 eh_britain.17.t:0 "Elizabethan era"
 eh_britain.17.d:0 "The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor period of the history of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603). Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history. The symbol of Britannia (a female personification of Great Britain) was first used in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over Spain. This "golden age" represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for theatre, as William Shakespeare and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the Protestant Reformation became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the Spanish Armada was repelled."
 eh_britain.17.a:0 "Golden Age!"
 eh_britain.18.t:0 "William Shakespeare"
 eh_britain.18.d:0 "William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language."

 eh_britain.19.d:0 "The Spanish Armada was a Habsburg Spanish fleet of 130 ships that sailed from Corunna in late May 1588, under the command of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, with the purpose of escorting an army from Flanders to invade England. The aim was to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and her establishment of Protestantism in England, to stop English interference in the Spanish Netherlands and to stop the harm caused by English and Dutch privateering ships that interfered with Spanish interests in the Americas. Unlike known, Many ships were wrecked on the coasts of Scotland and Ireland and more than a third of the initial 130 ships failed to return."

 eh_britain.20.t:0 "Union of the Crowns"
 eh_britain.20.d:0 "The Union of the Crowns was the accession of James VI of Scotland (r. 1567-1625) to the thrones of England and Ireland as James I (r. 1603-1625), and the consequential unification for some purposes (such as overseas diplomacy) of the three realms under a single monarch on 24 March 1603. The Union of the Crowns followed the death of James's cousin, Elizabeth I of England, the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty. England and Scotland continued as autonomous states sharing a monarch with Ireland (with an interregnum in the 1650s during the republican unitary state of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate), until the Acts of Union of 1707 during the reign of the last Stuart monarch, Anne (r. 1702-1714)."
 eh_britain.20.a:0 "Great!"
 eh_britain.21.t:0 "English Civil War"
 eh_britain.21.d:0 "The English Civil War (1642-1651) was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians ("Roundheads") and Royalists ("Cavaliers") principally over the manner of England's governance. The first (1642-1646) and second (1648-1649) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I (r. 1625-1649) against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (1649-1651) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II (r. 1660-1685) and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. The outcome of the war was threefold, the trial and execution of Charles I (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of English monarchy with, at first, the Commonwealth of England (1649-1653)."
 eh_britain.21.a:0 "Great!"
 eh_britain.22.t:0 "Commonwealth"
 eh_britain.22.d:0 "The Commonwealth was the political structure during the period from 1649 to 1660 when England and Wales, later along with Ireland and Scotland, were governed as a republic after the end of the Second English Civil War and the trial and execution of Charles I. The Protectorate began in 1653 when, following the dissolution of the Rump Parliament and then Barebone's Parliament, Oliver Cromwell was appointed Lord Protector of the Commonwealth under the terms of the Instrument of government. In 1659, the Protectorate Parliament was dissolved by the Committee of Safety as Richard Cromwell, who had succeeded his father as Lord Protector, was unable to keep control of the Parliament and the Army. This marked the end of the Protectorate and the start of a second period of rule by the Rump Parliament as the legislature and the Council of State as the executive."

 eh_britain.23.t:0 "Restoration"
 eh_britain.23.d:0 "The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland took place in 1660 when King Charles II returned from exile in Europe. The preceding period of the Protectorate and the civil wars, came to be known as the Interregnum (1649-1660).  In certain contexts it may be used to cover the whole period of the later Stuart monarchs as far as the death of Queen Anne and the accession of the Hanoverian George I in 1714; for example Restoration comedy typically encompasses works written as late as 1710."

The outcome of events in all three kingdoms and Europe, the Revolution was quick and relatively bloodless, though establishing the new regime took much longer and led to significant casualties. The Revolution was followed by pro-Stuart revolts in Scotland and Ireland, while Jacobitism persisted into the late 18th century. However, it ended a century of political dispute by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown, a principle established in the Bill of Rights 1689. Restrictions on Catholics contained in the 1678 and 1681 English and Scottish Test Acts remained in force until 1828; religious prohibitions on the monarch's choice of spouse were not removed until 2015, while restrictions on the monarch personally remain in place today."

The details of the Treaty were agreed on 22 July 1706, and separate Acts of Union were then passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland to put the agreed Articles into effect.

 eh_britain.27.d:0 "The Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria's reign, from 20 June 1837 until her death on 22 January 1901. The era followed the Georgian period and preceded the Edwardian period. Britain's relations with the other Great Powers were driven by the colonial antagonism of the Great Game with Russia, climaxing during the Crimean War; a Pax Britannica of international free trade was maintained by the country's naval and industrial supremacy. Britain embarked on global imperial expansion, particularly in Asia and Africa, which made the British Empire the largest empire in history. National self-confidence peaked."

 eh_britain.31.d:0 "The Scramble for Africa describes the invasion, annexation, division, and colonization of most of Africa by seven Western European powers during an era known as "New Imperialism" (between 1833 and 1914). The 10 percent of Africa that was under formal European control in 1870 increased to almost 90 percent by 1914, with only Liberia and Ethiopia remaining independent. The Berlin Conference of 1884 regulated the European colonisation and trade in Africa during the New Imperialism period. The General Act of Berlin can be seen as the formalisation of the Scramble for Africa that was already in full swing. Most of Africa was decolonised during the Cold War period. However, the old imperial boundaries and economic systems imposed by the Scramble still affect the politics and economy of African nations today."

 eh_britain.32.d:0 "The Great Game was a rivalry between the 19th-century British and Russian Empires over influence in Central Asia, primarily in Afghanistan, Persia, and Tibet. The two colonial empires used military interventions and diplomatic negotiations to acquire and redefine territories in Central and South Asia. Russia conquered Turkestan, and Britain expanded and set the borders of British colonial India. Though the Great Game was marked by distrust, diplomatic intrigue, and regional wars, it never erupted into a full-scale war directly between Russian and British colonial forces. Traditionally, the Great Game came to a close between 1895 and 1907."

Britain's Royal Navy controlled most of the key maritime trade routes and enjoyed unchallenged sea power.

It was an escalation of the Irish revolutionary period into warfare. In May 1921, Ireland was partitioned under British law by the government of Ireland Act, which created Northern Ireland. Both sides agreed to a ceasefire (or 'truce') on 11 July 1921. The post-ceasefire talks led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921. This ended British rule in most of Ireland and, after a ten-month transitional period overseen by a provisional government, the Irish Free State was created as a self-governing Dominion on 6 December 1922.

That treaty ended the three-year Irish War of Independence between the forces of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic. The Free State was established as a Dominion of the British Commonwealth of Nations. In 1931, with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, the Parliament of the United Kingdom relinquished nearly all of its remaining authority to legislate for the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of making the dominions fully sovereign states. The Free State thus became the first internationally recognised independent Irish state. In 1937 he drafted a new constitution, which was passed by a referendum in July of that year. The Free State came to an end with the coming into force of a new constitution on 29 December 1937 when the state took the name "Ireland"."

At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. India, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire. The Suez Crisis confirmed Britain's decline as a global power. The transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire."

The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UK's economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for UK higher education, academic research and security.

Bourbon monarchs then united to France the small kingdom of Navarre, which Henry's father had acquired by marriage in 1555, ruling both until the 1792 overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution. Restored briefly in 1814 and definitively in 1815 after the fall of the First French Empire, the senior line of the Bourbons was finally overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830. A cadet Bourbon branch, the House of Orleans, then ruled for 18 years (1830-1848), until it too was overthrown."

His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country in European history. In the age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralisation of power. An adherent of the concept of the divine right of kings, Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralised state governed from the capital. He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and, by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during Louis' minority. By these means he became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of absolute monarchical rule in France that endured until the French Revolution."

Although Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun in 1754, with what became known in the United States as the French and Indian War, the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria's desire to recover Silesia from Prussia. Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain's and Prussia's ever-growing might, France and Austria put aside their ancient rivalry to form a grand coalition of their own, bringing most of the other European powers to their side. Faced with this sudden turn of events, Britain aligned itself with Prussia, in a series of political manoeuvres known as the Diplomatic Revolution. However, French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed, and Britain's rise as among the world's predominant powers destroyed France's supremacy in Europe, thus altering the European balance of power."

The first part of his reign was marked by attempts to reform the French government in accordance with Enlightenment ideas. These included efforts to abolish serfdom, remove the taille (land tax) and the corvee (labour tax), and increase tolerance toward non-Catholics as well as the abolition of the death penalty for deserters. The French nobility reacted to the proposed reforms with hostility, and successfully opposed their implementation. Louis implemented deregulation of the grain market, advocated by his economic liberal minister Turgot, but it resulted in an increase in bread prices. From 1776, Louis XVI actively supported the North American colonists, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain, which was realised in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. The ensuing debt and financial crisis contributed to the unpopularity of the Ancien Regime. This led to the convening of the Estates-General of 1789. On 20 June 1789, the members of the French Third Estate took the Tennis Court Oath. It was a pivotal event in the French Revolution."

Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobles (the Second Estate), and peasants and bourgeoisie (the Third Estate). After the 1780s, discontent among the members of France's middle and lower classes resulted in strengthened opposition to the French aristocracy and to the absolute monarchy, of which Louis and his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette, were viewed as representatives. Louis's indecisiveness and conservatism led some elements of the people of France to view him as a symbol of the perceived tyranny of the Ancien Regime, and his popularity deteriorated progressively. His disastrous flight to Varennes in June 1791, four months before the constitutional monarchy was declared, seemed to justify the rumors that the king tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign intervention. The credibility of the king was deeply undermined, and the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an ever-increasing possibility."

The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon who brought many of its principles to areas he conquered in Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution made a profound impression on the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history. Historians attribute the causes of the French Revolution of 1789 to several intertwining factors: (1) Enlightenment philosophy desacralized the authority of the monarchy and the Catholic Church; (2) The emergence of an influential bourgeoisie which was formally part of the Third Estate (commoners); (3) France's debt, aggravated by French involvement in the American Revolution; (4) Strong opposition from provincial parlements to resistance to royal reforms; (5) The deregulation of the grain market. In order to resolve the crisis, the king summoned the Estates-General in May 1789 and, as it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed a National Assembly (June 1789) against the wishes of the king, signaling the outbreak of the French Revolution."

A central event of the first stage, in August 1789, was the abolition of feudalism and the old rules and privileges left over from the Ancien Regime. The next few years featured political struggles between various liberal assemblies and right-wing supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. The Republic was proclaimed in September 1792 after the French victory at Valmy. In a momentous event that led to international condemnation, Louis XVI was executed in January 1793, and Marie Antoinette was executed in October 1793. The National Convention lasted until 1795, power was effectively stripped from the elected deputies and concentrated in the small Committee of Public Safety from April 1793. The eight months from the fall of 1793 to the spring of 1794, when Maximilien Robespierre and his allies dominated the Committee of Public Safety, represent the most radical and bloodiest phase of the French Revolution, known as the Reign of Terror.

Subsequently these powers made several invasions of France by land and sea. However, the new French armies counterattacked, repelled the invaders, and advanced beyond France. The First Coalition collapsed, leaving only Britain in the field fighting against France. By the end of 1793 the allies had been driven from France.

 eh_french.50.d:0 "The Seven Years' War was a global war fought between 1756 and 1763. It involved all five European great powers of the time plus many of the middle powers and spanned five continents, affecting Europe, the Americas, West Africa, India. Although Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun in 1754, with what became known in the United States as the French and Indian War, the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria's desire to recover Silesia from Prussia. Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain's and Prussia's ever-growing might, France and Austria put aside their ancient rivalry to form a grand coalition of their own, bringing most of the other European powers to their side. Faced with this sudden turn of events, Britain aligned itself with Prussia, in a series of political manoeuvres known as the Diplomatic Revolution. However, French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed, and Britain's rise as among the world's predominant powers destroyed France's supremacy in Europe, thus altering the European balance of power."

 eh_french.51.d:0 "The French campaign against Korea was an 1866 punitive expedition undertaken by the Second French Empire in retaliation for the earlier Korean execution of several French Catholic missionaries. The encounter over Ganghwa Island lasted nearly six weeks. The result was a French retreat and a check on French influence in the region. The campaign, which lasted nearly six weeks, was the first armed encounter between Korea and a Western power. The overall result was a French retreat and a check on France's influence in the region. The violent encounter also confirmed Korea in its isolationism for another decade."

 eh_french.53.d:0 "The Franco-Prussian War was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871, the conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. On 16 July 1870, the French parliament voted to declare war on Prussia. French Emperor Napoleon III captured and the army of the Second Empire decisively defeated. A government of National Defence declared the Third French Republic in Paris on 4 September and continued the war for another five months; the German forces fought and defeated new French armies in northern France. The capital of Paris was besieged, and fell on 28 January 1871, after which a revolutionary uprising called the Paris Commune seized power in the city and held it for two months, until it was bloodily suppressed by the regular French army at the end of May 1871."

The Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 gave Germany most of Alsace and some parts of Lorraine. After 1850, the states of Germany had rapidly become industrialized, with particular strengths in coal, iron (and later steel), chemicals, and railways. In 1871, Germany had a population of 41 million people; by 1913, this had increased to 68 million. A heavily rural collection of states in 1815, the now united Germany became predominantly urban. During its 47 years of existence, the German Empire was an industrial, technological, and scientific giant, gaining more Nobel Prizes in science than any other country. By 1900, Germany was the largest economy in Europe, surpassing the United Kingdom, as well as the second-largest in the world, behind only the United States."

In response to reports of an armed invasion to lift the siege, the initially hesitant Empress Dowager Cixi supported the Boxers and on June 21 issued an Imperial Decree declaring war on the foreign powers. The Eight-Nation alliance, after being initially turned back, brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army, and arrived at Peking on August 14, relieving the siege of the Legations. Uncontrolled plunder of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, along with the summary execution of those suspected of being Boxers."

The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919, which drafted by U.S. president Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924). The Big Four (Britain, France, the United States, and Italy) imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the most well known being the German peace treaty—the Treaty of Versailles. Ultimately, as a result of the war the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian Empires ceased to exist, with numerous new states created from their remains. However, despite the conclusive Allied victory (and the creation of the League of Nations during the Peace Conference, intended to prevent future wars), a second world war would follow just over twenty years later."

The vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances, the Allies and the Axis. It was the most global war in history; it directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of total war, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of which were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease and the only use of nuclear weapons in war."

The Armistice was signed on July 27, 1953, and was designed to "ensure a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved." The signed Armistice established the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the de facto new border between the two nations, put into force a cease-fire, and finalized repatriation of prisoners of war.
